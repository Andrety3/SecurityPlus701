Change management processes are important for security because they help ensure updates to systems and policies are carefully planned, reviewed, tested, and documented. This reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities and helps maintain strong security by preventing unauthorized changes.

- Approval Process
An ineffective approval process could lead to changes being implemented without thorough vetting, which could accidentaly lead to the introduction of new system vulnerabilities
-Ownership in Change Management
What is ownership in change management?
It refers to individuals or groups that are primarily responsible for implementing a specific change. Owners are accountable for ensuring that the change is implemented as planned, risks are managed effectively, and there's a clear plan for communication and training associated with the change.
-Stakeholders
 a person, group or organization with a vested interest, or stake, in the decision-making and activities of a business, organization or project.
 -Impact Analysis
 The process of identifying and assessing the potential implications of a proposed change, including how the change will impact individual users, business processes, or interconnected systems
