# Explain the importance of change management processes and the impact to security.
## Business processes impacting security operation

Change management processes are important for security because they help ensure updates to systems and policies are carefully planned, reviewed, tested, and documented. This reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities and helps maintain strong security by preventing unauthorized changes.

### - Approval Process
An ineffective approval process could lead to changes being implemented without thorough vetting, which could accidentaly lead to the introduction of new system vulnerabilities

### -Ownership in Change Management
What is ownership in change management?
It refers to individuals or groups that are primarily responsible for implementing a specific change. Owners are accountable for ensuring that the change is implemented as planned, risks are managed effectively, and there's a clear plan for communication and training associated with the change.

### -Stakeholders
 a person, group or organization with a vested interest, or stake, in the decision-making and activities of a business, organization or project.

### -Impact Analysis
 The process of identifying and assessing the potential implications of a proposed change, including how the change will impact individual users, business processes, or interconnected systems
 
### -Test Results
How do test results play an important role in change management?
Before implementation, changes must first be evaluated in a test environment to ensure they work as intended and do not cause issues. Test results provide valuable insight into the likelihood of success and help identify potential issues without impacting business operations.

###-Backout Plan
A contingency plan for reversing changes and returning systems and software to their original state if the implementation plan fails.

###-Maintenence Window
An approved time frame for implementing changes

###-What are Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)?
Detailed, written instructions that describe how to carry out routine operations or changes. 

## â€¢ Technical implications

### - Allow lists/deny lists
What are the technical implications of allow/deny lists in change management?
Allow and block lists describe software restriction approaches designed to control computer software. Allow lists help streamline change management by reducing the time and effort required for trusted or preauthorized changes. Deny lists help prevent unauthorized or risky changes from being implemented.

### - Restricted activities
What are restricted activities in change management?
They refer to actions or changes that require additional scrutiny, strict controls, or higher levels of approval/authorization due to their potential impact on critical systems, sensitive data, or regulatory compliance.

### - Downtime
Refers to a period during which a system, service, or piece of equipment is unavailable or inoperative.

### - Service restart
Service restarts are typically used for background processes without significantly impacting user activities.

### - Application restart

### - Legacy applications

### - Dependencies
